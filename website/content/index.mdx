<Hero>Composable, responsive, React-based data visualization</Hero>

<HomepageDemoContainer />

## Why?

I've worked with a few great, battle-tested React data-vis libraries, including [Formidable](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory), [Nivo](https://github.com/plouc/nivo) and [React-Vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis). While these are often enough to produce beautiful charts with very few lines of code, they have limitations when attempting to integrate with more complicated data-centered apps.

Some of the things I struggled with were:

- applying responsive design principles to alter text or visual design depending on screen size
- rescaling axes in response to user interaction or container size
- supporting non-mouse events that modern users tend to expect, like swipe and pinch gestures
- seemlessly interconverting between SVG (server-side rendering!) and canvas (animations! performance!)
- using component-centric engineering to mix chart types or creates new types

Hypocube introduces a layer of indirection between the "data", as mapped on a Cartesian plane, and the "design", authored in units of pixels. A base Chart component manages the scaling and passes it down via context. Hypocube uses several parts of [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) to manipulate drawing instructions, but takes a React-based approach to managing the DOM - and the canvas context.

## Quick Start

Add Hypocube to your existing React project:

```bash
npm i --save hypocube
```

Create a component:

```javascript
import { Chart, XAxis, YAxis, BarVerticalSeries } from 'hypocube';

const MyChart = () => (
  <Chart
    height={100}
    // the bounds of the chart, relative to the actual data:
    view={[0, 0, 4, 5]}
    isCanvas={false}
    chartStyle={{
      dataBoxFill: 'blue',
      // makes the width of the boxes dependent on the total width available:
      dataBoxThickness: ({ pxWidth }) => pxWidth / 10,
    }}
  >
    <XAxis />
    <YAxis />
    <BarVerticalSeries
      data={[
        [1, 3],
        [2, 2],
        [3, 5],
      ]}
    />
  </Chart>
);
```

And render your chart with:

```javascript
<MyChart />
```

or

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<MyChart />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

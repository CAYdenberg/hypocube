Composable, responsive, React-based data visualization

<HomepageDemoContainer />

## Motivation

The visual presentation of quantitative data has always been a challenge on the web, and how to adapt to the world of responsive design is still unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us spent too much time consulting graphs and charts that were either hard to use, misleading/inaccurate, or both. The smaller the screen, the more frustrating to the user.
Adapting a chart to a screen of unknown size might seem an impossible task - but interactivity gives us an added dimension to create data experiences which are just as content-rich, and just as accurate, regardless of the pixels available.

Hypocube is partly a distillation of a few years publishing scientific papers, and a few more as a freelance frontend developer serving research organizations. It is lessons learned from working at the interface of science and the web. It is also a passion project I started in the dark pandemic winter of 2020-21. In a time when we've never had access to more data, how we present that data matters more than ever.

## Quick Start

Add Hypocube to your existing React project:

```bash
npm i --save hypocube
```

Create a component:

```javascript
import { Chart, XAxis, YAxis, BarVerticalSeries } from 'hypocube';

const MyChart = () => (
  <Chart
    height={100}
    // the bounds of the chart, relative to the actual data:
    view={[0, 0, 4, 5]}
    isCanvas={false}
    chartStyle={{
      dataBoxFill: 'blue',
      // makes the width of the boxes dependent on the total width available:
      dataBoxThickness: ({ pxWidth }) => pxWidth / 10,
    }}
  >
    <XAxis />
    <YAxis />
    <BarVerticalSeries
      data={[
        [1, 3],
        [2, 2],
        [3, 5],
      ]}
    />
  </Chart>
);
```

And render your chart with:

```javascript
<MyChart />
```

or

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<MyChart />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

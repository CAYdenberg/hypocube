Composable, responsive, React-based data visualization

<DemoContainer />

## Motivation

The visual presentation of quantitative data has always been a challenge on the web, and how to adapt it to the world of responsive design has been unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us spent too much time consulting graphs and charts that were either hard to use, misleading/inaccurate, or both. The smaller the screen, the more frustrating for the user. Adapting a chart to a screen of unknown size might seem an impossible task - but interactivity gives us an added dimension to create data experiences which are just as content-rich, and just as accurate, regardless of the pixels available.

Hypocube is partly a distillation of a few years publishing scientific papers, and a few more as a freelance frontend developer serving research organizations. It is lessons learned from working at the interface of science and the web. It is also a passion project I started in the dark pandemic winter of 2020-21. In a time when accurate communication seems in short supply, I hope others find it useful.

Composable, responsive, React-based data visualization

<DemoContainer />

## Motivation

The visual presentation of quantitative data has always been a challenge on the web, and further adapting to the world of responsive design has been a difficult task. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us spent too much time consulting graphs and charts that were either hard to use, misleading/inaccurate, or both. This was especially true on mobile devices. Adapting a chart to a viewport of unknown size might seem an impossible task - but with the added dimension of _interactivity_ we can create data experiences which present just as much data, just as accurately, on a wide variety of devices.

Hypocube is partly a distillation of a few years publishing scientific papers, and a few more as a freelance frontend developer serving research organizations. It is lessons learned from working at the interface of science and the web. It is also a passion project I started in the dark pandemic winter of 2020-21. (It's taken some to get here). In a time when accurate communication seems in short supply, I hope others find it useful.

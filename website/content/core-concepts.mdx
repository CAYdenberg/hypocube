## Content vs Presentation

Ever since Ethan Marcotte coined the term ["responsive web design"](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/), it has been a core value of the modern web. From the principle insight that **content is distinct from presentation,** Marcotte developed the idea that the style of a website can adapt based on device capabilities, without changing the semantic meaning of the content. This has actually become _more_ important in the intervening years, thanks to media like Accelerated Mobile Pages, Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News, to say nothing of an ever-greater variety of screens. At the end of the day, authors rarely know the exact format in which their content will reach their readers.

Tools for applying responsive principles to charts and graphs have lagged. This is because charts are neither text (which typically compress horizontally and expand vertically as the viewport shrinks), nor images (which typically compress along both dimensions to maintain the aspect ratio). What is needed is a clean separation of concerns when talking about charts: what is content (in this case, data), and what is presentation (style)?

One solution comes from a book totally unrelated to the web: [_The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by Edward Tufte, first published in 1975. Tufte describes the parts of a graph that do not contain information "non-data ink". For example, the two charts below both show the same data:

import CoreConceptsDemo from '../../sandbox/CoreConceptsDemo';
import { CoreConceptsDemoContainer } from '../../sandbox/demo';

<CoreConceptsDemoContainer>
  <CoreConceptsDemo />
  <CoreConceptsDemo reduceInk={true} />
</CoreConceptsDemoContainer>

The point is that **the widths and the heights of the ranges represent different things: the vertical positions are content and cannot be changed because they directly represent data**. The horizontal distances, even though they are also composed only of distances/pixels, are not a representation of data and are properly thought of as styles.

Usually, HTML is used to talk about content and CSS is used to talk about style. If CSS had a `tukey-box-width` property, we could then restyle the chart with media queries, with no change to the content. Of course this doesn't work: there is no HTML (or SVG) element for data on a graph, so it must be composed out of more fundamental SVG elements, which themselves represent shapes. Hypocube uses React to compose fundamental shapes into semantically meaningful chart components, and uses a custom CSS-like scheme to provide chart styles at varying levels of specificity. As with CSS, these styles can be inherited from parent elements.

## Responsiveness

What about responsiveness? All chart styles are **contextual**: which means they can optionally be provided as functions of the chart's _actual_ width and height. This allows a similar outcome to what can be achieved with media queries, except that they are constructed as functions of the width of the _chart_, not the whole page.

## Defining Space

When specifying distance along an axis, sometimes we want to think in terms of actual data coordinates, and sometimes we need to think in pixels. Throughout the docs, we use the following conventions to denote different types of scale:

- In the **pixel scale** we are specifying units of pixels. Except for chart styles and the gutter attribute, you probably won't have to think about the pixel scale often; the conversions are handled under the hood. Coordinates in the pixel scale can be used directly used in SVG or canvas to create shapes.

- The **Cartesian scale** is a linear transformation of the pixel scale which is useful for thinking about our data. It is a Cartesian plane with an x-axis increasing from left to right and a y-axis increasing from bottom to top - just like in high school math. For most kinds of graphs, the Cartesian scale is enough to plot your data.

- If some cases where the data is logarithmic or categorical, it is first converted to a linear scale so that it can be represented on a Cartesian plane. [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) is an excellent tool for this. We refer to this as the **data scale**, though mostly Hypocube doesn't touch it.

## Interactivity

What if you simply don't have enough space for your data? We are working in a programmatic medium, and can solve this through interaction! In other words, the chart `view` can be updated to give users access to data which isn't initially visible.

Specifically, an `onGesture` prop accepts a callback which will report the extent to which the view _should_ be moved in response to pinch, swipe, drag and other move events. (Hypocube aims to be as declarative as possible, and _won't automatically update the view_: but hooks are provided as addons that respond to these callbacks with state updates and animations). This is possible largely to the fabulous [@use-gesture](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/) library.

Callbacks can also be passed to most chart elements to produce other types of interactivity, for example clicking/tapping on a data point. Hypocube uses [pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) to simplify the inconsistencies between mouse and touch devices. Event handlers are called with coordinates that are _semantically meaningful in the data_, not (just) the raw coordinates of the event.

## Composability

Elements such as axes render a number of different sub-components, most of which can be replaced with render props. In cases where the `chartStyles` don't provide enough flexibility, nearly any sub-component can be completely replaced.

## SVG vs Canvas

Hypocube can render in either SVG or Canvas, with the sole difference being that event callbacks on _individual chart components won't be called during canvas rendering_ (event callbacks on the containing chart component still will be). The change is triggered by a single prop, so an SVG-rendered chart can be switched to canvas while animating and then switched back to re-active element interaction.

All provided components can be rendered server-side while in SVG mode, although a server-rendered chart won't automatically adapt to its container width.

All Hypocube chart components are composed out of a small number of primitives. These primitives provide both SVG and canvas rendering information: therefore if render props are used to replace sub-components, canvas rendering will still work as long as these primitives are used as the building blocks for the new elements.

## HTML layer

Tooltips are a very common pattern in web charts. Hypocube allows rendering of HTML elements at absolute positions defined on the Cartesian scale.

An important pattern used in building websites is that **content should be authored separately from presentation**. As the complexity of websites has grown, this distinction has become more critical. Most importantly, it allows for the style of a website to adapt based on device capabilities, _without altering the content_, commonly known as responsive design.

While the web community generally now agrees that all websites should be built to be responsive, tools for applying responsive principles to visual data (charts and graphs) have lagged. This is mainly because we lack clean separation of concerns: when can space in a chart adapt to the overall space available without altering the meaning?

## Content vs Presentation

Edward Tufte describes the parts of a graph that do not contain information "non-data ink". For example, the two charts below both show the same data:

The key is that **the width of the bar and the height of bar represent different things: the height is content and cannot be changed because it directly represents data**. The width, even though it also makes use of distances, is _not a representation of data and is properly thought of as a style._

Usually in web design, HTML is used to talk about content and CSS is used to talk about style. If CSS had a `bar-width` property, we could then restyle the chart with media queries, with no change to the content. Of course this doesn't work: there is no HTML (or SVG) element for data on a graph: it must be composed out of more fundamental SVG elements that represent shapes. Hypocube uses React to compose fundamental shapes into semantically meaningful chart components, and uses a custom CSS-_like_ strategy to provide chart styles at varying levels of specificity. As with CSS, these styles are inherited from parent elements if they aren't specified.

## Responsiveness

What about responsiveness? All chart styles are **contextual**: which means they can optionally be provided as functions of the chart's _actual_ width and height. This allows a similar outcome to what can be acheived with media queries, except that they are constructed as functions of the width of the _chart_, not the whole page.

## Interactivity

What if you simply don't have enough space for your data? An `onGesture` prop accepts a callback which will report the extent to which the view _should_ be moved in response to pinch, swipe, drag and other move events. (Hypocube aims to be as declarative as possible, and _won't automatically update the view_: but hooks are provided as addons that respond to these callbacks with state updates and animations).

Callbacks can also be passed to most chart elements to produce other types of interactivity, for example clicking/tapping on a data point. Hypocube uses [pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) to simplify the inconsistencies between mouse and touch devices. Event handlers are called with coordinates that are _semantically meaningful in the data_, not (just) the raw coordinates of the event.

## Defining Space

When specifying distance along an axis, sometimes we want to think in terms of actual data coordinates, and sometimes we need to think in pixels. For example, in the chart below, the positions of the tick marks are specified as data - the "50" tick mark represents a position with respect to actual data, but the length of the tick marks is a kind of style and have any semantic meaning:

Throughout the docs, we use the following conventions to denote different types of scale:

- In the **pixel scale** we are specifying units of pixels. Except for chart styles and the gutter attribute, you probably won't have to think about the pixel scale often; the conversions are handled under the hood. Coordinates in the pixel scale can be used directly used in SVG or canvas to create shapes.

- The **Cartesian scale** is a linear transformation of the pixel scale which is useful for thinking about our data. It is a Cartesian plane with an x-axis increasing from left to right and a y-axis increasing from bottom to top. For some kinds of graphs, the Cartesian scale is enough to plot your data.

- If your data is logarithmic or categorical, or based on dates, you'll need to first convert it to a linear scale so that it can be represented on a Cartesian plane. d3-scale is an excellent tool for this. We refer to this as the **data scale**, though mostly Hypocube doesn't touch it.

## Composability

Elements such as axes render a number of different sub-components, most of which can be replaced with render props. In cases where the `chartStyles` don't provide enough flexibility, nearly any sub-component can be completely replaced.

[See how you can compose new types of charts with render props](./advanced-components)

## SVG vs Canvas

Hypocube can render in either SVG or Canvas, with the sole difference being that event callbacks on _individual chart components won't be called during canvas rendering_ (event callbacks on the containing chart component still will be). The change is triggered by a single prop, so an SVG-rendered chart can be switched to canvas while animating and then switched back to re-active element interaction.

All provided components can be rendered server-side while in SVG mode, although a server-rendered chart won't automatically adapt to its container width.

All Hypocube chart components are composed out of a small number of primatives. These primatives provide both SVG and canvas rendering information: therefore if render props are used to replace sub-components, canvas rendering will still work as long as these primatives are used as the building blocks for the new elements.

## HTML layer

Tooltips are a very common pattern in web charts. To allow rendering of HTML elements at particular positions, a renderHTML prop is provided that will render absolutely positioned elements outside of the SVG or canvas container.

import GestureDemo from '../../../sandbox/GestureDemo';

Hypocube aims to make it easy to change the chart viewbox in response to basic mouse and touch gestures, including swipe and pinch zoom. To see how this works, consider the following example:

```javascript
const { onGesture, view, scrollToView } = usePannable([-10, -10, 20, 20]);

return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <p>
      Left: {view.xMin.toFixed(2)} | Right: {view.xMax.toFixed(2)} | Top:{' '}
      {view.yMax.toFixed(2)} | Bottom: {view.yMin.toFixed(2)}
    </p>
    <p>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => scrollToView(view.zoom(0.5))}>
        Zoom Out
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => scrollToView(view.zoom(2))}>
        Zoom In
      </button>
    </p>
    <TheChart isCanvas={isCanvas} onGesture={onGesture} view={view} />
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

<GestureDemo isCanvas={true} />

As you might have guessed, `TheChart` is not the interesting part here, it merely renders a bunch of concentric diamonds centered on the origin. This gives us a sense of what's happening. Try clicking and dragging, or, if you have a touch device, try swiping or pinch-zooming.

The "magic" is made possible by the `usePannable` hook, which works a bit like `useState`. The initial view (in the form `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`) is passed as an argument, and the hook returns some stuff that leds us read and manipulate the view. `view` and `onGesture` are just passed down to the `Chart` as props. We can also manipulate the view directly with `setView` and `scrollToView`. To do that, we first have to discuss how views are handled within Hypocube.

## Manipulating the Viewbox

When we create a chart, we generally pass a `view` prop consisting of an array of four numbers: `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`. Under the hood, Hypocube converts this to a `Viewbox` object that contains this data, and other useful properties (like the xMax). It also has a few useful methods for manipulating the view. (Note: `Viewbox` objects are immutable: the methods that return Viewboxes actually create new ones, leaving the original in tact).

To create a Viewbox, use the `createViewbox` function, which can accept: (1) an array in the form above, or the four numbers as separate arguments.

### Viewbox properties

Props are public, but do not manipulate them directly:

`xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax, width, height`

### Viewbox methods that return viewboxes (chainable)

`setEdges({ xMin: number, yMin: number, xMax: number, yMax: number }) => Viewbox` Replaces any edge (which is not undefinied), leaves the others in tact.

`panX(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox horizontally to the right. To move left, use a negative number.

`panY(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox vertically down. To move up, use a negative number.

`zoom(factor: number, anchor?: [x, y]) => Viewbox` Zoom in (factors greater than 1) or out (factors less than 1). `anchor` defaults to the center of the current viewbox.

`interpolate(final: Viewbox, progress: number) => Viewbox`. Returns a viewbox interpolated between `final` and the current view. `progress` would normally be between 0 and 1.

`bound(boundingBox: Viewbox) => Viewbox`. Slide the current viewbox to fit within the bounding box. If the current view is too big, it will shrink just enough to fit.

`constrainZoom({ maxZoomX: number, maxZoomY: number }): Viewbox`. Zoom the current viewbox out until its width is at least maxZoomX or its height is at least maxZoomY. Used to prevent the viewbox from getting zoomed in too far. To keep the viewbox from being zoomed _out_ too far, use `bound`.

### Other Viewbox methods

`toPath(): [number, number][]` Returns four points representing a rectangle around the current viewbox.

`isEqual(test: Viewbox): boolean` Returns `true` when the current viewbox is _equivalent to_ (all four sides are the same as) `test`.

`pointsWithinX(points: Point[]) => Point[]`. Filter out all points that don't fall within the viewbox on the x-axis.

`pointsWithinY(points: Point[]) => Point[]`. Filter out all points that don't fall within the viewbox on the y-axis.

### Viewbox manipulation examples

With these methods we can do some useful things. For example:

"Swipe" the viewbox right, but keep it within a bounding box. Then, rescale the y-axis to fit around the data in the new view.

```javascript
const next = view.panX(view.width).bound(boundingBox);
return next.setEdges({
  yMin: 0,
  yMax: findExtremes(next.pointsWithinX(dataSeries)).yMax + 10,
});
```

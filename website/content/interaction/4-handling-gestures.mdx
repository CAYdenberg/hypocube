Hypocube aims to make it easy to change the chart viewbox in response to basic mouse and touch gestures, including swipe and pinch zoom. To see how this works, consider the following example:

As you might have guessed, `TheChart` is not the interesting part here, it merely renders a bunch of concentric diamonds centered on the origin. This gives us a sense of what's happening. Try clicking and dragging, or, if you have a touch device, try swiping or pinch-zooming the chart.

The "magic" is made possible by the `usePannable` hook, which works a bit like `useState`. The initial view (in the form `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`) is passed as an argument, and the hook returns some stuff that leds us read and manipulate the view. `view` and `onGesture` are just passed down to the `Chart` as props. We can also manipulate the view directly with `setView` and `scrollToView`. To do that, we first have to discuss how views are handled within Hypocube.

## Manipulating the Viewbox

When we create a chart, we generally pass a `view` prop consisting of an array of four numbers: `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`. Under the hood, Hypocube converts this to a `Viewbox` object that contains this data, and other useful properties (like the xMax). It also has a few useful methods for manipulating the view. (Note: `Viewbox` objects are immutable: the methods that return Viewboxes actually create new ones, leaving the original in tact).

To create a Viewbox, use the `createViewbox` function, which can accept: (1) an array in the form above, or the four numbers as separate arguments.

### Viewbox methods

`setEdges({ xMin: number, yMin: number, xMax: number, yMax: number }) => Viewbox` Replaces any edge (which is not undefinied), leaves the others in tact.

`panX(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox horizontally to the right. To move left, use a negative number.

`panY(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox vertically down. To move up, use a negative number.

`zoom(factor: number, anchor?: [x, y]) => Viewbox` Zoom in (factors greater than 1) or out (factors less than 1). `anchor` defaults to the center of the current viewbox.

`interpolate(final: Viewbox, progress: number) => Viewbox`. Returns a viewbox interpolated between `final` and the current view. `progress` should be between 0 and 1.

`bound(boundingBox: Viewbox) => Viewbox`. Move the current viewbox so that it retains its current width and height but fits within the bounding box.

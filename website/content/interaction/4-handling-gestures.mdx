Hypocube aims to make it easy to change the chart viewbox in response to basic mouse and touch gestures, including swipe and pinch zoom. To see how this works, consider the following example:

```javascript
const { onGesture, view, scrollToView } = usePannable([-10, -10, 20, 20]);

return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <p>
      Left: {view.xMin.toFixed(2)} | Right: {view.xMax.toFixed(2)} | Top:{' '}
      {view.yMax.toFixed(2)} | Bottom: {view.yMin.toFixed(2)}
    </p>
    <p>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => scrollToView(view.zoom(0.5))}>
        Zoom Out
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => scrollToView(view.zoom(2))}>
        Zoom In
      </button>
    </p>
    <TheChart isCanvas={isCanvas} onGesture={onGesture} view={view} />
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

<GestureDemo isCanvas={true} />

Hypocube aims to make it easy to change the chart viewbox in response to basic mouse and touch gestures, including swipe and pinch zoom. To see how this works, consider the following example:

As you might have guessed, `TheChart` is not the interesting part here, it merely renders a bunch of concentric diamonds centered on the origin. This gives us a sense of what's happening. Try clicking and dragging, or, if you have a touch device, try swiping or pinch-zooming the chart.

The "magic" is made possible by the `usePannable` hook, which works a bit like `useState`. The initial view (in the form `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`) is passed as an argument, and the hook returns some stuff that leds us read and manipulate the view. `view` and `onGesture` are just passed down to the `Chart` as props. We can also manipulate the view directly with `setView` and `scrollToView`. To do that, we first have to discuss how views are handled within Hypocube.

## Manipulating the Viewbox

When we create a chart, we generally pass a `view` prop consisting of an array of four numbers: `[xMin, yMin, width, height]`. Under the hood, Hypocube converts this to a `Viewbox` object that contains this data, and other useful properties (like the xMax). It also has a few useful methods for manipulating the view. (Note: `Viewbox` objects are immutable: the methods that return Viewboxes actually create new ones, leaving the original in tact).

To create a Viewbox, use the `createViewbox` function, which can accept: (1) an array in the form above, or the four numbers as separate arguments.

### Viewbox properties

Props are public, but do not manipulate them directly:

`xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax, width, height`

### Viewbox methods that return viewboxes (chainable)

`setEdges({ xMin: number, yMin: number, xMax: number, yMax: number }) => Viewbox` Replaces any edge (which is not undefinied), leaves the others in tact.

`panX(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox horizontally to the right. To move left, use a negative number.

`panY(distance: number) => Viewbox` Move the viewbox vertically down. To move up, use a negative number.

`zoom(factor: number, anchor?: [x, y]) => Viewbox` Zoom in (factors greater than 1) or out (factors less than 1). `anchor` defaults to the center of the current viewbox.

`interpolate(final: Viewbox, progress: number) => Viewbox`. Returns a viewbox interpolated between `final` and the current view. `progress` would normally be between 0 and 1.

`bound(boundingBox: Viewbox) => Viewbox`. Slide the current viewbox to fit within the bounding box. If the current view is too big, it will shrink just enough to fit.

`constrainZoom({ maxZoomX: number, maxZoomY: number }): Viewbox`. Zoom the current viewbox out until its width is at least maxZoomX or its height is at least maxZoomY. Used to prevent the viewbox from getting zoomed in too far. To keep the viewbox from being zoomed _out_ too far, use `bound`.

### Other Viewbox methods

`toPath(): [number, number][]` Returns four points representing a rectangle around the current viewbox.

`isEqual(test: Viewbox): boolean` Returns `true` when the current viewbox is _equivalent to_ (all four sides are the same as) `test`.

`pointsWithinX(points: Point[]) => Point[]`. Filter out all points that don't fall within the viewbox on the x-axis.

`pointsWithinY(points: Point[]) => Point[]`. Filter out all points that don't fall within the viewbox on the y-axis.

### Viewbox manipulation examples

With these methods we can do some useful things. For example:

#### Panning example

Pan the viewbox right, but keep it within a bounding box. Then, rescale the y-axis to fit around the data in the new view.

```javascript
const next = view.panX(view.width).bound(boundingBox);
return next.setEdges({
  yMin: 0,
  yMax: createViewboxFromData(next.pointsWithinX(data)).yMax + 10,
});
```

#### Pan to end example

Pan the viewbox to the right end of the bounding box, keeping the same y-axis and width:

```javascript
return view.setEdges({
  xMax: boundingBox.xMax,
  xMin: view.xMax - view.width,
});
```

#### Zooming example

Zoom in by 200% on the xAxis, within reason, but keep the y-axis the same:

```javascript
return view
  .zoom(2)
  .constrainZoom({
    maxZoomX: MAX_ZOOM_X,
  })
  .setEdges({
    yMin: view.yMin,
    yMax: view.yMax,
  });
```

## usePannable

Now that we understand how to manipulate viewboxes, let's see how to use them in practice.

The `usePannable` hook acts like React's `useState`, but for viewboxes.

```javascript
const { view, setView, scrollToView, onGesture, isPanning } = usePannable(
  [0, 0, 10, 10],
  options
);
```

The `onGesture` return value can be plugged directly into `<Chart />`

```javascript
const { view, setView, scrollToView, onGesture, isPanning } = usePannable(
  [0, 0, 10, 10],
  options
);

<Chart view={view} onGesture={onGesture}></Chart>;
```

while `setView` and `scrollToView` are used to otherwise manipulate the viewbox (e.g., with buttons). `isPanning` is a boolean that tells you whether the chart is currently in motion.

### Options

The following options are passed to `usePannable` as the second argument:

- `animationDuration: number` Total time for animation when a swipe gesture occurs or when `scrollToView` is called. Default: 600 ms.

- `animationStepFunction: (progress: number) => number` Easing function to for the animation. Default: d3's [`easeCubicOut`](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease#easeCubicOut)

- `rescale: (viewbox: Viewbox, gestureData?: ChartGestureEvent) => Viewbox` The `onGesture` event handler created by `usePannable` will automatically move the viewbox by in response to drag and swipe gestures. The `rescale` option can be used to apply constraints to this automatic movement. The default is the identity function `view => view`. The same function is also applied after `setView` and `scrollToView`. If desired, the entire ChartGestureEvent (see below) is also passed as a second argument when this is function is called in response to a gesture event (it is not passed if triggered by `scrollToView`).

## onGesture

Similar to Chart pointer events, Hypocube rescales and remaps the event associated with gestures to provide useful information about the chart. While in most cases it will be enough to plug the `onGesture` function returned by `usePannable` directly into the chart, it is also possible to compose your own gesture event handlers. The `ChartGestureEvent` objects created by Hypocube have the following properties:

<PropDef name="transform" type="(initial: Viewbox) => Viewbox">
  A function to update the viewbox based on its current value.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="phase" type="'start' | 'continue' | 'end'"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="intent" type="'scroll' | 'swipe' | 'zoom'"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="state">
  This contains the full{' '}

    gesture state object from '@use-gesture/react'
  </a>
</PropDef>

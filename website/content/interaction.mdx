Interactivity is supported by Hypocube at two levels: pointer events and gestures.

Pointer events are [browser events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) intended to simplify the differences between mouse and touch events: therefore, Hypocube uses them instead of the more familiar mouse events, like `onClick`. Pointer event handlers can be passed to the `Chart`, as well as most elements contained within the `Chart`. These latter handlers will not fire when rendering in canvas-mode, however. A typical use for pointer events would be display a tooltip when a data point is clicked (or touched). [Read more about pointer events.](/interaction/1-pointer-events)

Gesture handlers are passed only to `Chart` elements. They can be used to handle click-and-drag-type mouse movements, touch screen, and Mac trackpad gestures. A typical use for gesture handlers is to pan or zoom the map in response to gestures, like Google Maps. [Read more about gestures.](/interaction/4-handling-gestures/)

Ultimately, all components in Hypocube are composed out of the same set of primitives. These base-layer components are responsible for SVG and canvas drawing, and converting between the Cartesian and pixel scales.

## Line

The simplest component: a line connecting a set of points on the Cartesian scale. The line may be curved, or dashed.

<PropDef name="path" type="Array<[number, number]>" required>
  A set of points, which are themselves a bipartite array in the form [x, y].
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="stroke" type="color | null" def="#000"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="strokeWidth" type="number" def="1"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="fill" type="color | null" def="null"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="curveType" type="string | D3CurveFactory" def="linear">
  The "curve type" represents a function to calculate the shape of the line in
  between the data points, and can be a string or a{' '}
  <a href="http://using-d3js.com/05_04_curves.html">
    d3 curve factory function
  </a>
  . The available built-in curve types are "linear", "cardinal", "natural", "basis",
  or "step".
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="dash" type="string | [number, number]" def="solid">
  This property represents the type of dash. It can be a bipartite array
  representing the number of rendered pixels followed by the number of blank
  pixels, or a string. The available built-in dash types are "solid", "dashed"
  (equivalent to `[5, 5]`), or "dotted" (equivalent to `[1, 1]`).
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="svgPointerEvents" type="boolean" def="true">
  When false, sets pointer-events: none as an inline style. Useful for for
  restricting events to the underlying elements, especially the Chart element.
</PropDef>

### PxLine

A variant of `Line`, which accepts the same props, but in which the `path` is specified on the pixel scale instead of the Cartesian scale.

### TranslatedLine

A variant of `Line`, in which a set of points given on the pixel scale is rendered relative to an anchor point given on the Cartesian scale. It accepts the same props as `Line` (the path is in pixels), an an additional prop:

<PropDef name="point" type="[number, number]" required>
  The anchor point for the rest of the path, on the Cartesian scale.
</PropDef>

## Text

Renders the text given in the `text` prop at `position` on the Cartesian scale.

<PropDef name="position" type="[number, number]" required>
  The position of the text, given in the form [x, y].
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="text" type="string" required>
  The text to be rendered.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="pxOffset" type="[number, number]">
  An optional offset added to the position, in pixels.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="color" type="color" def="#000"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="font" type="string" def="Helvetica"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="fontSize" type="number" def="16"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="align" type="'left' | 'center' | 'right'" def="left"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="rotation" type="number" def="0">
  Text rotation, in radians. (For vertical, bottom-to-top text, set to `0.5 *
  Math.PI`).
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="svgPointerEvents" type="boolean" def="true">
  When false, sets pointer-events: none as an inline style. Useful for for
  restricting events to the underlying elements, especially the Chart element.
</PropDef>

## Symbol

A Symbol is a defined shape that renders at a particular point on the Cartesian scale. The type of Symbol can be given by a keyword, or a [D3 Symbol](https://observablehq.com/@d3/fitted-symbols).

<PropDef name="point" type="[number, number]" required>
  The position of the symbol on the Cartesian scale.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="size" type="number" def="5">
  Size of the symbol in pixels. For a circle, this corresponds to the diameter.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="symbol" type="string | D3SymbolType" def="circle">
  A string refering to a type of symbol, or a{' '}
  <a href="http://using-d3js.com/05_10_symbols.html">d3 symbol function</a>. The
  available built-in types are "circle", "cross", "diamond", "square", "star",
  "triangle", "wye" and "none".
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="stroke" type="color" def="#000"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="strokeWidth" type="number" def="1"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="fill" type="color" def="1"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="quietRenderRadius" type="number" def="0">
  When SVG rendering, an invisible circle of the given radius is rendered around
  the symbol. This ensures that the Symbol is clickable, even when the actual
  symbol drawn is very small. Note that by default the value is 0, which means
  only the symbol itself is rendered.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="svgPointerEvents" type="boolean" def="true">
  When false, sets pointer-events: none as an inline style. Useful for for
  restricting events to the underlying elements, especially the Chart element.
</PropDef>

## Handle

The `Handle` component renders an SVG `g` element that binds all passed event handlers to it. It "remaps" the callbacks passed to these handlers to extract positional information about the event, and return it in a form meaningful on the Cartesian scale. In addition to the [pointer event handlers themselves](/interaction/1-pointer-events), the `Handle` component accepts the following props:

<PropDef name="elementPosition" type="[number, number]">
  A semantically meaningful position for the element on the Cartesian scale. For
  example, for a data point, this would be the actual position of the point. For
  a "range"-type element, it would be the anchor point of the range. The prop is
  not required, but callbacks triggered on a Handle without it will have an
  undefined `elementPosition` in the passed event object.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="meta" type="Record<string | boolean | number>">
  Any meta data that needs to be passed back to the event handlers. If not
  specified, an empty object will be passed instead.
</PropDef>

## Clip

The children of a Clip component will visibly render only within the path passed to Clip as a prop. This primitive is used to keep data series from displaying on top of axes, for example.

<PropDef name="path" type="Array<[number, number]> | null">
  Children <em>outside</em> of this path will not render. If the value is null
  or undefined, or an empty array, then everything will render.
</PropDef>

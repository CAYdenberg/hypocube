import PropDef from '../components/PropDef';

"Furniture" is the term used colloquially (and somewhat disparagingly) to refer to parts of the chart that do not contain data.

## Tick Marks

Tick marks are rendered by axes to indicate how a position relates to real-world data. There are two tick mark components: `XTickMark` and `YTickMark` which both accept the same props:

<PropDef name="position" type="[number, number]" required>
  The position of the tick mark on both axes, given in the form [x, y].
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="label" type="string" def="(empty string)">
  Label on the tick mark.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="chartStyle" type="ChartStyle">
  See also the `axisTick` and `fontSize` declarations.
</PropDef>

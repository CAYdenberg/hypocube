A **range series** is similar to a bar series, but it is used to represent _ranges_ of data along the primary axis, instead of a single point. Like a bar series, it has only stylistic or no meaning along the secondary axis. The `RangeSeries` component will, by default, draw **whiskers** (often used to represent error bars). By using the flexible `renderRanges` prop, however, it can be used to draw range representations in a variety of ways. See [composing charts](/composing-charts/) for an example of how it can be used to create a Tukey ("box-and-whisker") plot.

## Understanding Anchors

All data elements in Hypocube have an _anchor point_ that is used to report the element position when an event occurs. The Range Series (like the Line Series) does not render anything at this point by default, but the anchor point position is still reported to event callbacks. You can, however, make the anchor visible by setting the `dataRangeAnchorLength` chart style declaration.

```javascript react-live=true
<Chart height={100} view={[0, 0, 4, 6]} isCanvas={false}>
  <XAxis />
  <YAxis />
  <RangeVerticalSeries
    data={[
      { anchor: [1, 3], ranges: [0.5, 3.5] },
      { anchor: [2, 2], ranges: [1.5, 2.5] },
      { anchor: [3, 5], ranges: [2.5, 5.5] },
    ]}
    chartStyle={{
      dataWhiskerStroke: 'blue',
      seriesXOffset: -8,
    }}
  />
  <RangeVerticalSeries
    data={[
      { anchor: [1, 1], ranges: [0.5, 1.5] },
      { anchor: [2, 1.5], ranges: [1, 2] },
      { anchor: [3, 2.5], ranges: [2, 3] },
    ]}
    chartStyle={{
      dataWhiskerStroke: 'red',
      seriesXOffset: 5,
      dataRangeAnchorLength: 16,
      dataRangeAnchorStroke: 'red',
      seriesXOffset: 8,
    }}
  />
</Chart>
```

## Multiple Ranges

## Props

import PropDef from '../components/PropDef';

<PropDef name="data" type="Array<{ anchor: Point, ranges: number[] }>" required>
  An array of range data to render. Each data point is given as an `anchor`
  (which is just a `[x, y]` Point) and an array of numbers, which are the range
  values in the y dimension. In the example chart above, two values are given
  for each `ranges` property. If more values are given, a whisker will be drawn
  between each contiguous pair of values. For example, if the ranges array has
  three members, a whisker will be drawn between the first and second points,
  and another whisker will be drawn between the second and third.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="chartStyle">
  Styles declarations which will override the global{' '}
  <a href="/basic-charts/2-chart-style#dataranges">chart style</a>. The
  dataRange declarations are mostly of interest for this type of series.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="handlerMeta" type="Record<any>">
  Metadata to pass to{' '}
  <a href="/interaction/1-pointer-events/">handler callbacks</a>.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="view" type="[number, number, number, number]">
  A viewbox, specified as [xMin, yMin, width, height]. Any part of the data
  which falls outside of this viewbox will be clipped (not shown). The default
  value is the viewbox of the Chart. If `null` is passed explicitly, no clipping
  will occur (data may render in the gutter).
</PropDef>
<PropDef
  name="renderAnchor"
  type="React.Component<{ x: number; y: number; chartStyle }>"
>
  Render prop for the anchors. See the{' '}
  <a href="/composing-charts/1-data-components/">data component docs</a> for
  more information. By default it renders a `DataAnchor` and a replacement
  component should accept the same props.
</PropDef>
<PropDef
  name="renderRanges"
  type="React.Component<{ x: number; yMin: number; yMax: number; chartStyle }>"
>
  Render prop for the ranges. See the{' '}
  <a href="/composing-charts/1-data-components">data component docs</a> for more
  information. By default it renders a `DataWhiskerVertical` and a replacement
  component should accept the same props.{' '}
  <strong>
    Unlike the other render props, this can accept an array of components.
  </strong>{' '}
  When multiple ranges are rendered (see the data property above), each
  component will be used in succession. See the example in{' '}
  <a href="/composing-charts/">Composing Charts</a> for how to use this to
  create Tukey plots.
</PropDef>

Additionally, the range series component accepts all the [pointer event handlers](/interaction/1-pointer-events/), which are rendered around each range point.

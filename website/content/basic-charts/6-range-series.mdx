A **range series** is similar to a bar series, but it is used to represent _ranges_ of data along the primary axis, instead of a single point. Like a bar series, it has only stylistic or no meaning along the secondary axis. The `RangeSeries` component will, by default, draw **whiskers** (often used to represent error bars). By using the flexible `renderRanges` prop, however, it can be used to draw range representations in a variety of ways. See [composing charts](../composing-charts) for an example of how it can be used to create a Tukey ("box-and-whisker") plot.

## The Principle of Inheritance

Chart styles are designed to have a CSS-like interface. First and foremost, this means that "specific declarations beat general declarations." In the chart below, there are two line series. The first has a specific style applied. The second has no specific style applied, and therefore defaults to the style given on the general Chart component.

```javascript react-live=true
<Chart
  width={300}
  height={300}
  view={[0, 0, 4, 5]}
  chartStyle={{
    dataLineStroke: 'blue',
    dataPointFill: 'blue',
    dataPointSymbol: 'diamond',
  }}
>
  <XAxis />
  <YAxis />
  <LineSeries
    data={[
      [1, 3],
      [2, 2],
      [3, 5],
    ]}
    chartStyle={{
      dataLineStroke: 'green',
      dataPointFill: 'green',
      dataPointSymbol: 'cross',
    }}
  />
  <LineSeries
    data={[
      [1, 1],
      [2, 3],
      [3, 5],
    ]}
  />
</Chart>
```

## Contextual Chart Styles

In responsive design, styles often depend on the viewport width or other "device capabilities", authored in CSS either as media queries or as properties given as a fraction of container width. All chart styles can be given as a function of the rendered height and width of the chart, in the form `({ pxWidth, pxHeight }) => (property value)`. This means that, for example, the width of a bar or the font size on an axis label can be adjusted to fit the available space.

In this example, the bar in the bar graph will always be rendered at half the width of the total chart width, and will change color depending on the width. (You can change it by adjusting the maxWidth of the containing div).

```javascript react-live=true
<div style={{ maxWidth: 1024 }}>
  <Chart
    width={300}
    height={100}
    view={[0, 0, 4, 5]}
    isCanvas={false}
    chartStyle={{
      dataBoxFill: 'blue',
      dataBoxThickness: ({ pxWidth }) => pxWidth / 2,
      dataBoxFill: ({ pxWidth }) => `rgba(12, 12, 254, ${pxWidth / 1024})`,
    }}
  >
    <XAxis />
    <YAxis />
    <BarVerticalSeries data={[[2, 2]]} />
  </Chart>
</div>
```

## The styles

Similar to CSS, all chart elements have access to all possible chart styles, although only a few are relevant. In the documentation of each component, we'll note the styles that are most often used to apply to that element, in particular.

**Note:** In the list below, "color" indicates any color string allowed by CSS.

<PropDef name="fontSize" type="number" def="16">
  Help wanted: encode font family, and font weight.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisColor" type="color" def="#666">
  Stroke color the axis line, tick marks, tick mark labels, and axis label.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisColor" type="color" def="#666">
  Stroke color the axis line, tick marks, tick mark labels, and axis label.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisStrokeWidth" type="number" def="2">
  Stroke width of the main axis line.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisTickLength" type="number" def="10">
  Length of axis tick marks.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisTickOffset" type="number" def="0">
  Distance between the axis and the start of the tick mark. Normally, 0.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisTickLabelOffset" type="number" def="2">
  Distance between the end of the tick mark and the nearest edge of the label.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="axisLabelOffset" type="number" def="50">
  Total distance between the axis line and the nearest edge of the axis label.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="dataBoxFill" type="color" def="#000">
  A "dataBox" is a rectangle used to indicate a data point (by stretching to the
  0 value on the same axis) or a data range (by stretching between two values on
  the same axis). It is most commonly used in conjunction with the a Bar series.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="dataBoxStroke" type="color" def="#000"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="dataBoxStrokeWidth" type="number" def="0"></PropDef>
<PropDef name="dataBoxThickness" type="number" def="10">
  The length of the data box across the axis opposite to the one in which the
  box indicates data. In a vertical bar series, it would be the width of the
  data box; in a horizontal bar series, it would be the height.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="dataBoxLeftOffset" type="number" def="-0.5">
  The offset of the data box along the non-data axis relative to its thickness.
  For a single bar series, it is usually
</PropDef>

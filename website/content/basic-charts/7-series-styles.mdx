Hypocube allows specification of styles at the level of the entire chart or at the level of individual components. When dealing with multiple data series, it's convenient to be able to rapidly generate a set of styles to differentiate series from each other. The most common uses for this are offsetting bar charts so that series display next to each other, and getting a range of colors to distinguish series of any chart type.

## The Principle of Inheritance

Chart styles are designed to have a CSS-like interface. First and foremost, this means that "specific declarations beat general declarations." In the chart below, there are two line series. The first has a specific style applied. The second has no specific style applied, and therefore defaults to the style given on the general Chart component.

## Contextual Chart Styles

In responsive design, styles often depend on the viewport width or other "device capabilities", authored in CSS either as media queries or as properties given as a fraction of container width. All ChartStyles can be given as a function of the rendered height and width of the chart, in the form `({ pxWidth, pxHeight }) => (property value)`. This means that, for example, the width of a bar or the font size on an axis label can be adjusted to fit the available space.

## The styles

Similar to CSS, all chart elements have access to all possible chart styles, although only a few are relevant. In the documentation of each component, we'll note the styles that are most often used to apply to that element, in particular.

A line series can be used to represent data in two ways: (1) as data points rendered at the actual coordinates given, and as a line connecting those data points. By default, only the line is rendered; points can be shown by setting a value for the `dataPointSymbol` style declaration. Conversely, the line can be hidden by setting the `dataLineStrokeWidth` style declaration to 0.

It is important to note that [event handles are created at the actual points](/interaction/1-pointer-events/) within the series, regardless of whether the data points are visible. This is because the line does not have any data-centric meaning: it is an imaginary way of connecting data points. The actual target size of these invisible handles can be controlled with the `dataPointMinTargetRadius` style declaration.

```javascript react-live=true
<Chart height={300} view={[0, 0, 4, 5]} gutter={[5, 5, 5, 5]}>
  <XAxis />
  <YAxis />
  <LineSeries
    data={[
      [1, 3],
      [2, 2],
      [3, 3.5],
    ]}
    chartStyle={{
      dataLineStroke: 'green',
      dataPointFill: 'green',
    }}
  />
  <LineSeries
    data={[
      [1, 1],
      [2, 3],
      [3, 4],
    ]}
    chartStyle={{
      dataLineStroke: 'blue',
      dataPointFill: 'blue',
      dataPointSymbol: 'circle',
    }}
  />
</Chart>
```

## Props

import PropDef from '../components/PropDef';

<PropDef name="data" type="Point[]" required>
  An array of Points (itself a bipartite array of [x, y] values).
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="view" type="[number, number, number, number]">
  A viewbox, specified as [xMin, yMin, width, height]. Any data point that falls
  outside of this box will not be rendered. The default value is the viewbox of
  the Chart.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="chartStyle">
  Styles declarations which will override the global{' '}
  <a href="/basic-charts/2-chart-style#databoxes">chart style</a>. Usually, the
  databox styles are used with this type of data series.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="handlerMeta" type="Record<any>">
  Metadata to pass to{' '}
  <a href="/interaction/1-pointer-events">handler callbacks</a>.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="view" type="[number, number, number, number]">
  A viewbox, specified as [xMin, yMin, width, height]. Any part of the data
  which falls outside of this viewbox will be clipped (not shown). The default
  value is the viewbox of the Chart. If `null` is passed explicitly, no clipping
  will occur (data may render in the gutter).
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="renderLine" type="React.Component<{ data; chartStyle }>">
  Render prop for the line connecting the data points. See the{' '}
  <a href="/composing-charts/1-data-components">data component docs</a> for more
  information. By default it renders a `DataLine` and a replacement component
  should accept the same props.
</PropDef>
<PropDef
  name="renderPoint"
  type="React.Component<{ x: number; y: number; chartStyle }>"
>
  Render prop for the line connecting the data points. See the{' '}
  <a href="/composing-charts/1-data-components">data component docs</a> for more
  information. By default it renders a `DataPoint` and a replacement component
  should accept the same props.
</PropDef>

Additionally, the line series component accepts all the [pointer event handlers](/interaction/1-pointer-events/), which are rendered around the individual data points.

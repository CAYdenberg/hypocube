The Chart is the base component used to render all chart elements. It is responsible for creating the basic dimensions of the Chart in pixels, and the visible portion of the chart coordinates on the [Cartesian scale](/core-concepts#definingspace).

## Props

<PropDef name="view" type="[number, number, number, number]" required={true}>
  The coordinates of the box containing the visible portion of the chart data.
  Given as an array in the form: [x minimum, y minimum, width, height] on the
  Cartesian scale.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="ssWidth" type="number" def="300">
  Rendered width of the Chart during server-side rendering. During client-side
  rendering, the width is determined by layout calculated by the browser, which
  will usually be the width of the Chart's containing element, or the maxWidth
  property.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="maxWidth" type="number | string">
  CSS property used to contain the Chart's width. May be a number (`300`) or a
  string (`"100%"`). If this value is left undefined, the Chart will normally
  expand horizontally to fill its container.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="height" type="number | (number => number)" def="150">
  Rendered height in pixels. If a function is given, the height will be
  calculated from the rendered width.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="gutter" type="[number, number, number, number]">
  Extra padding (given in pixels) added to each side of the chart. This is
  useful for ensuring that axes and other Chart decorations have enough space
  for proper rendering regardless, of the actual dimensions available. Given in
  the form [top, right, bottom, left], on the pixel scale.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="chartStyle">
  Sets styles which will apply to all chart elements. See{' '}
  <a href="./2-chart-style/">ChartStyle</a>.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="onGesture">
  Handler for gestures, usually (but not necessarily) used to dynamically change
  the `view`. See{' '}
  <a href="/interaction/4-handling-gestures/">how to handle gestures</a>.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="htmlLayer">
  A React component (or array of React components) which render HTML, and are
  absolutely positioned above the SVG (or canvas). Can be used to render
  tooltips (though they don't have to be). See{' '}
  <a href="/interaction/2-tooltips/">tooltips for more information</a>.
</PropDef>
<PropDef name="renderError" type="React.Component{ message: string }>">
  A React component which will be rendered in case of an error that occurs while
  rendering the chart. The component may accept the error `message` as its only
  prop.
</PropDef>

Additionally, the chart element accepts all the [pointer event handlers](/interaction/1-pointer-events/).

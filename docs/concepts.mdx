# Core Concepts

## Responsiveness as a first-class citizen

Edward Tufte describes the parts of a graph that do not contain information "non-data ink". For example, the two charts below both show the same data:

If CSS had the appropriate properties, we could then restyle the chart based on media queries, with no loss of the actual data presented:

### Chart Styles

Since we don't have those properties at our disposal, however, Hypocube provides a CSS-like set of properties that can be used to style nearly any element of a graph:

These declarations are all optional, and are also **contextual**: they can be provided as functions of the ChartState, which include its rendered height and width.

Like CSS, we can override those styles, and the more targeted declaration will be inherited by that element's children:

### Hypocube Space

When specifying distance along an axis, sometimes we want to think in terms of actual data coordinates, and sometimes we need to think in pixels. For example the graph below specifies its viewbox (LINK), cleanly declaring what data will actually be visible. But we can also add a gutter (LINK) which is added to that viewbox to ensure we have enough space below the x-axis and to the left of the y-axis for the various labeling information we need. If the viewbox changes, the gutter will stay constant, so the axes don't drift around.

Throughout the docs, we use the following conventions to denote the different types of scale:

- In the **pixel scale** we are specifying units of pixels. Except for chart styles and the gutter attribute, you probably won't have to think about the pixel scale often; the conversions are handled under the hood. Coordinates in the pixel scale can be used directly used in SVG or canvas to create shapes.

- The **Cartesian scale** is a linear transformation of the pixel scale which is useful for thinking about our data. It is a Cartesian plane with an x-axis increasing from left to right and a y-axis increasing from bottom to top. For most kinds of graphs, the Cartesian scale is enough to plot your data.

- The **data scale** is a higher level of abstraction used for types of data that aren't obviously Cartesian. For example, where is the origin of a graph used to plot dates? Log scales need to be converted first to linear scales to make interactions meaningful. As the content author, you can think about your data in a way that makes sense to you.

## Rescaling

The nature of responsive design means that users with smaller screens should have access to the same data as other users, it just might not all be in front of them all the time. One way to facilitate access to data beyond what is displayable, is to make it possible to pan or zoom the axes based on mouse or touch interactions.

## Element Interactivity

Hypocube uses pointer events (LINK) to simplify the inconsistencies between mouse and touch devices. Event handlers are called with the coordinates of the gesture in both the pixel and Cartesian scale, in addition to the React SyntheticEvent (link). Event handlers passed to individual elements will also report the _anchor point_ of the element, and any other metadata you think you'll need.

NOTE: PointerEvents are not yet supported in Safari, so be sure to add a polyfill (LINK).

### Composability

You can use most elements out of the box, or configure them with a few simple props, but it is also possible to replace nearly any child element using a "composer" higher-order component. This system allows you to, for example, specify an alternative `TickMark` that will be called by an `Axis` component and passed a defined set of props you can use for drawing it at the right place.

See a detailed example in the `XAxis` component documentation (LINK).

### SVG vs Canvas

Our aim is to be able to render in either SVG or Canvas, with the sole difference being that eventing functions on individual elements won't be called during canvas rendering (eventing functions on the chart itself still will be). The change is triggered by a single prop, so an SVG rendered chart can be switched to canvas while panning/zooming the axes are being resized, and then switched back to SVG when done.
